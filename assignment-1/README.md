## Usage
#### Training
```
python main.py train <path/to/training/file> <language>
```
The probabilities will be saved in `data/model.<language>`.
The training performs an 80/10/10 split into training, validation and test data. Using the validation data, it performs a grid search to find the optimal hyperparameters. After this, it reports the perplexity of the resulting model on the test set.
#### Generating
```
python main.py generate <language>
```
This will require the probabilities file `data/model.<language>` to exist.
#### Calculating perplexity
```
python main.py perp <path/to/document> <language>
```
The document to specify the path of is any document to calculate the perplexity of in the given language.
This will also require the probabilities file `data/model.<language>` to exist.

##### Clone repository
```
git clone https://github.com/mansoldm/anlp-coursework.git
```
##### Making changes
After making changes to one or more files, stage them
```
git add file1 file2 ... filen
```
can also add them one by one or use regex

Create a commit with these changes (don't forget the `-m`).
```
git commit -m "type what you did here"
```
Finally push the commit to the remote
```
git push
```
Pushing won't work if you haven't pulled new commits that I have already pushed
#####Â Getting new changes
To get a commit that somebody else has pushed
```
git pull
```
Only execute this command when you don't have any outstanding changes. Not too much of an issue, just makes things easier/avoids unnecessary headaches
